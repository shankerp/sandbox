Python HOWTOs
*************

Python HOWTOs are documents that cover a single, specific topic, and
attempt to cover it fairly completely. Modelled on the Linux
Documentation Project's HOWTO collection, this collection is an effort
to foster documentation that's more detailed than the Python Library
Reference.

Currently, the HOWTOs are:

* Python Advocacy HOWTO
* Porting Extension Modules to 3.0
* Curses Programming with Python
* Descriptor HowTo Guide
* Idioms and Anti-Idioms in Python
* Functional Programming HOWTO
* Regular Expression HOWTO
* Socket Programming HOWTO
* Sorting HOW TO
* Unicode HOWTO
* HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib2
* HOWTO Use Python in the web
